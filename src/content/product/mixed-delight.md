## Can't Decide? Go With This!

## Frozen Donuts - For Best Results

Store your frozen donuts in their packaging at 0째 F / -17째 C. Stored properly, they should keep for 2-3 months. To defrost, remove from packaging and transfer to a plate. Let thaw at room temperature for about an hour.

To reheat the donuts, you can use a microwave (15-20 second bursts) or oven (350째 F / 177째 C for 5 minutes or until desired temperature is reached).
